# Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest 
# values in the array. Note: the built-in min(v1, v2) and max(v1, v2) functions return the smaller or 
# larger of two values.

	nmax = nums[0]                        # does not contain elements less than 0 (if so, we won't have the smallest value)
	for i in range(1, len(nums)):         # starting from 1 because nums[0] is already taken and checking it doesn't make sense
