# return sum of rounded values a, b, c. rounding goes as follows: to the nearest 10, if ends with <5, you round down,
# if >=5, you round up. You should use a helper function in order not to repeat the code 3 times while summing.

def round_sum(a, b, c):
	return round10(a) + round10(b) + round10(c)

	if modulo < 5:
		num = num - modulo
	else:
		num = num + 10 - modulo
	return num
